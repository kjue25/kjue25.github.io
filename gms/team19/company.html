     <h3> Q- What makes you stand out from the other companies? </h3>
     <p> A- There are many things that make Pinned stand out from other companies. 
         Within seventh grade entre, we are the only team doing decorations with 
         letters and symbols. Uniquely from Pinned are the inspirational quote tags. 
         When people buy our products, we want to give them something more than a pin
          board. Especially during the pandemic, everyone could use a bit more 
          inspiration. So we put a variety of inspirational quotes on all of our
           products to make people feel happier. </p>

     <h3> Q- What inspired you to do this project? </h3>
     <p> A- Our main motivation for this choice was that it was unique and would be 
         fun to make. Because we are the only team doing this kind of decoration, it
          means that we have the benefit of low competition, and more customers buying
           our products specifically. </p>

     <h3> Q- What is your teamâ€™s work culture? </h3>
     <p> Pinned is based on helping customers happy. Not just giving customers exactly 
         What they want, but inspiring them to feel a little happier, or motivated to accomplish 
         a goal. We also care about ideas. If someone on the team has an idea or an opinion, 
         it will be thought over, and never shot down. You can count on being happy and motivated 
         as a customer, investor, or team member. </p>

     <h3>>Q- What cost benefits does your team have?</h3>
     <p> If you take a look at our cost of goods, then you can see that our products only cost $_.__ 
         to make. We also use softwood for our products to save money, and time without lowering our 
         quality. We are planning on selling our products for $5-7, which gets us a profit of $_.__. </p>
