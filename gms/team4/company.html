    <h1> Plan de Vida </h1>
     <p> Hi! We’re Sophia and Cara, the co-founders of Plan de Vida. 
         We both know what a pain and challenge it is to stay organized and ready for your day without a planner. 
         We also know how hard it is to write stuff down in your planner. 
         That’s where PV  (Plan de Vida) comes in! PV is a quick and easy way to organize yourself and life.
          This calendar sits in front of you during the day and is beautiful and fun to look at and use. 
         We also want to help you keep track of your goals so we have very cool themed goals for the month. 
         We also have personal goals that you can use to make anything you want!
          Our calendars are easy and fun to use and we try our best to make them as beautiful as possible. 
         Thank you so much for reading about our company! 
    </p>

<h1> Our Story </h1>
<p>
    Ever since they were little, Cara and Sophia have always loved art.
    They have always been inspired by the world around them and think it’s an incredible thing to incorporate into their art.
     When coming up with business ideas, Cara and Sophia had a hard time deciding as it’s often difficult to just decide on one thing. 
     They concluded it can be very helpful to go with your passion when it comes to businesses. 
     When coming up with ideas, they found it helpful to mash several different ideas into one. 
     They both love art and they both found it important to set goals. Plan de Vida came to life!
     They want to try to make Plan de Vida the best they can! 
</p>
<h1> Behind The Name </h1>
<p> In Spanish, “plan” means plan (easy enough :) and “Vida” means life. 
When you put it all together you get a plan for life! 
That is what we want the calendar to be for you: a plan for life —Plan de Vida! </p>
