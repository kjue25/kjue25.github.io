        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <h3>Our Name </h3>
            The word Malie is the Hawaiian word for calm.
             We chose this name because it feels like you are going to 
             a tropical island while using our product.  
             We wanted a name that meant something in a different language, 
             and I think we picked the right one. You'll feel calm and relaxed 
             when using our Heating Pillow, by Malie &Co.
