            Chloe:
            I love drawing and reading in my free time. 
            I have two cute cats (Joe and Juliette) and love hugging them! (when they let me)

            Alyssa:
            During my free time, I enjoy jumping and flipping on my trampoline, digital drawing, 
            and hanging out with my dog (Cody) and my cat (Callie). 
            I enjoy eating all foods, and I am not afraid to try new things!

            I love hanging out with my doggy Allie and my friends. 
            In my free time I enjoy art and musical theater! My favorite candy is sour patch :)
