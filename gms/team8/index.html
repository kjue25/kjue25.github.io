            Hi there! Our names are Ria, Alyssa, and Chloe. We came together and thought up the idea of Jot Jars, or pencil jars. 
            This idea came up when we were trying to decide what to do, and I looked at my desk and saw my jar holding my pencils and pens. 
            During remote learning, everyone is working at home, so you donâ€™t need a pencil pouch to carry your pens around because you are always working in the same place. 
            Everyone needs a little fun in their lives right now, so why not add some color to your jar?
