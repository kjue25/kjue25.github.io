    <h1>Our Story</h1>
    <p>Our team is a fun and productive group.
         We decided on making etched glass.
         Our product is a simple yet beautiful piece of art.
         We wanted to choose something that people would find interesting and that wasnâ€™t too difficult to make.
        Etched glass is dishwasher friendly. Our product is an amazing decoration and a wonderful gift to a family member or friend. 
        We will offer different types of of glasses and designs. 
        We put a lot of effort into our product and make sure each one will be made with kindness. 
        </p>
