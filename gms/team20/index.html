 Hello there you have made it to the stick together home page where we will tell you a little bit about our 
 product and all of the uniqe designs we have. Are your items too boring? Well you have come to the right place. 
 Our stickers are the perfect fit for any plain old laptop, water bottle, or any other personal items! 
 Our stickers are our own designs, meaning we have made every design ourselves. The stickers are the cutest and the most popular designs,
They are handmade from the design process to the printing.  We also offer sticker packs for less price than each individual sticker, 
so you get stickers for a good deal.

    <p>
    Our cost of goods per sticker is 27 cents.
              According to our feedback
              forms a little more than a half of our customers are willing to pay one dollar or
              more (58 out of 103) and
              37 percent are willing to pay 50 cents (38 out of 103 ) With these prices we could have
              a profitable business.  
    Only 1.9 percent of people filling out the form are uninterested in buying our product (2 out of 103).
   After this positive feedback we decided to keep on working on this
          project improving our product designs.
          We have a very organized work process and every member
          Of the team has something that they can bring to the table.
