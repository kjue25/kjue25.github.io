            Welcome to our company page! We are a group of seventh graders who are working together
        to make our first company. We are very excited to have you here and we hope to intrest you in our designs.
        Our team consists of three people, Penelope
               Jasmeet and Lillian. All three of us have been interested in art and drawing and found stickers
               really as a really solid product. We have all been doing art for a pretty long time.
